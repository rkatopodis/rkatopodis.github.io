Hi, I'm Rafael! I'm broadly interested in the area of machine learning (ML), with a particular focus on sequential decision-making with reinforcement learning (RL) and lighter-weight neural network architectures, such as n-tuple networks (also known as weightless neural networks)

I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science (magna cum laude, 2019) and a M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence (2022) from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil. My master's dissertation dealt with the use of n-tuple neural networks in RL and you can find it [here](https://rkatopodis.github.io/files/Reinforcement_Learning_with_Weightless_Neural_Networks.pdf).
